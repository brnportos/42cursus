Nate walked to his window and looked at the Shenandoah Valley 1,000 meters below.
It was covered with new snow.

Breakfast was black coffee, which he had with his nurse, Sergio.
For the last four months, Sergio had also been his best friend.
He knew everything about the miserable life of Nate O'Riley.
