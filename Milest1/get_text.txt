Compilation

It must be possible to compile the project with the usual flags, and with the
-D BUFFER_SIZE as well.
The project must compile successfully both with and without this flag, in addition to the
following flags: -Wall -Wextra -Werror.
If there is an error, the evaluation stops here.
You can keep going and discuss the implementation of the code, but the
assignment will not be graded.

As the evaluator, you are expected to provide a main which will always check:

    The return value of the get_next_line is NULL in case of error.
    Otherwise, the function returns the line read, always with a \n at the end except if the end of file was reached and does not end with a \n character.

Test all the possible combinations of the following rules:

    Large BUFFER_SIZE (>1024)
    Small BUFFER_SIZE (< 8, and 1)
    BUFFER_SIZE exactly the length of the line to read

    1 byte variant (+/-) between the line and the BUFFER_SIZE

    Read on stdin

    Read from a file

    (Multiple/Single) Long line (2k+ characters)

    (Multiple/Single) Short line (< 4 characters, even 1)

    (Multiple/Single) Empty line

These tests should allow you to assess the robustness of the student's
get_next_line implementation.
